This project is abandoned, and only used as a temporary place for me to aggregate posts for ngnuggets.com until I finish building out the admin portion of that app.

Originally, this Nx repo was going to begin with my personal website, stevewitman.com, and ngnuggets.com, with the possibility of adding another app or two. Since it made more sense for these to live in separate repos, I chose to rebuild them in separate Anglular apps in separate repos.
