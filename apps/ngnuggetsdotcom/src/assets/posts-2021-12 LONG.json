With a long history, matured tooling and rich developer ecosystem, it is not difficult to see why Angular is the SPA framework of choice for building modern web/mobile apps. However, how does Angular work for desktop apps? The classic software answer applies—it depends.

It is a really bad user experience.\n\nHow can we change that behavior? Well, we need to monitor user activity in our application. After login instead of redirecting the user to a home page, we can take the URL before the login page and redirect him to that page. I like this behavior more than the first one.",

It seems as if engineers do not have a solid foundation of testing principles and how to keep the testing code as clean as the production code. In this session, you will learn how to organize your tests, what are the difference between different testing types, test doubles, schools of testing and most importantly how to write re-usable, maintainable, non-brittle and clean tests. The session will combine a lot of coding examples of bad testing practices and how to refactor your test with good practices in mind. By the end of it, you should be able to write clean test code.",

I will assume you already know the basics of Ngrx or other Redux pattern-based state management tools and are also pretty familiar with Angular and Typescript, as I will go pretty quick on the details.\n\nOne of the most common situations when using a reactive state management library is handling asynchronous API. The most common approach to tackling async operations is creating three actions for each possible outcome (request/success/failure) and making a side effect handling each of them. It is also common to have some flags in our state that track the store's current state.",

The leeway that Angular allows, with rapid prototyping, opens up the possibility for our team to create a proof of concept with the same code without the need to rebuild what we've previously implemented for iterations.
