And it's absolutely fine to use some out-of-the-box solutions for it if your application uses some library like NgBootstrap or Material UI all round and the designs and functionality they provide is satisfactory to you.\n\nBut once you bump into the need of re-styling or customization of it you usually may choose the way of creating a wrapping component which uses this out-of-the-box component inside and re-define its behaviour or styles by breaking original component encapsulation.",

        "description": "During the Corona pandemic, many companies and employees discovered home office. As a result, it became apparent that not every employee required his own workstation. Instead, companies now offer a shared desk model. This means that employees flexibly share workstations. Often, you can reserve your desired workstation in advance. This workplace booking function has attracted me for some time. I find the possibility to create a Custom Reactive Form in Angular, which also includes an office plan, particularly interesting. In the Custom Angular Reactive SVG Form there is the possibility to select a workstation from the office plan and to mark it with a color. As soon as a workstation has been chosen, the form will be validated and the desk will be bookable. In the following the implementation is explained step by step.",

        "description": "When we start to learn Angular, we know that there're two types of directives: Attribute and Structural directives. Here we will focus on Structural Directives only. Well, Structural directives allow us to modify the DOM tree of the element, not just the element itself (like Attribute directives do). This includes being able to remove an element and replace it with something else, creating additional elements, and so forth.",

No matter what theater you go to, or what movie you see, you'll notice some very similar things - most notably, the large screen the movie plays on. This screen is an excellent example of a reusable object - it can show any movie projected onto it! The screen doesn't need to know the details of the movie it's playing - all it does is show whatever content is projected onto it.\n\nThis is a similar idea to how content projection works in web development! Today, we'll go over what content projection looks like and how you can use it to make components that are reusable and less tied to the data they display.\n\nWe'll be using Angular for these examples, but any framework you'd like to use likely has a way to do this as well!",

        "description": "Jest is user-friendly, has a great command-line interface, and most importantly it's fast. Jest is fast because doesn't have to spin up a browser but instead runs its tests against a virtual DOM. The virtual DOM has many advantages but it also makes debugging Angular components harder. In this video, I am going to show you a nice tip on how to improve your debugging experience with Jest while writing Angular component tests.",

One of these features is offered by the Angular Router, called \"Lazy loading\".",
