Instead, companies now offer a shared desk model. This means that employees flexibly share workstations. Often, you can reserve your desired workstation in advance. This workplace booking function has attracted me for some time. I find the possibility to create a Custom Reactive Form in Angular, which also includes an office plan, particularly interesting. In the Custom Angular Reactive SVG Form there is the possibility to select a workstation from the office plan and to mark it with a color. As soon as a workstation has been chosen, the form will be validated and the desk will be bookable. In the following the implementation is explained step by step.",

This screen is an excellent example of a reusable object - it can show any movie projected onto it! The screen doesn't need to know the details of the movie it's playing - all it does is show whatever content is projected onto it.\n\nThis is a similar idea to how content projection works in web development! Today, we'll go over what content projection looks like and how you can use it to make components that are reusable and less tied to the data they display.\n\nWe'll be using Angular for these examples, but any framework you'd like to use likely has a way to do this as well!",

Sometimes it is also sent to the server for intermediate storage before the final submission. Using Angular, a common approach is to create one form per page, within the container component. The form is validated on submit, before moving to the next step. The form data is either stored in a service, populating the final model, and/or sent to the server. This approach works fine, however it is limited. Navigating between steps might cause inconsistencies as a change in a previous step might have impact on the final model data.",

One of the key factors that make a good test stand out is the arrange (or setup) part. For Angular component tests, Single Component Angular Modules (SCAMs) help to make the difference between an OK test and a good test. With SCAMs, you end up with no fragile test setups with half of the code, which results in a happy and productive, team that isn't afraid to move things around.",

Unfortunately large projects use an increasing number of http requests and data objects, so that the NgRx store is increasing as well. Both the number of state objects and actions and the complexity of the store become difficult to deal with. This article introduces solutions to make store contents more clear.",
