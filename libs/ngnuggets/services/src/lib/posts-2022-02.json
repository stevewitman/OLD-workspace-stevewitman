Sometimes it is also sent to the server for intermediate storage before the final submission. Using Angular, a common approach is to create one form per page, within the container component. The form is validated on submit, before moving to the next step. The form data is either stored in a service, populating the final model, and/or sent to the server. This approach works fine, however it is limited. Navigating between steps might cause inconsistencies as a change in a previous step might have impact on the final model data.",
